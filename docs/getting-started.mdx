This guide walks you through a series of steps to perform based on your [role](/community/user-profiles#profiles).

If you are looking for an introductory overview of Capact and want to learn more about basic Capact terminology, check the [Glossary and Concepts](#glossary-and-concepts).

## Glossary and Concepts

This section guides you through common topics about Capact:

1. [Introducing Capact](/blog/introducing-capact) blog post to learn what problems Capact aims to solve and why it was created in the first place.

This section groups resources to get familiar with Capact based on your role.

import clsx from "clsx";

export const Icon = ({_, iconName}) => (
	<i className={clsx("material-icons")}>{iconName}</i>
);

## <Icon iconName="people" /> System User

System User operates Capact Actions and manages TypeInstances related to the Actions.

The recommended way to try out Capact quickly is to set up a local development environment:

1. [Install the Capact CLI](./cli/getting-started.mdx).
2. [Bootstrap a local Capact cluster using k3d or kind](./installation/local.mdx).
    >**NOTE:** To access an already provisioned cluster, contact System Administrator for Capact Gateway credentials.
3. Use the Capact CLI to deploy real life scenarios. For example, [Rocket.Chat](./example/rocketchat-installation.md).
4. Share feedback via [**Slack**](/community/slack) or [**GitHub**](https://github.com/capactio/capact/issues)!

### Advanced concepts

1. Learn about [Action Policy](./feature/policies/action-policy.md) to find out how to customize Action execution.

2. Bootstrap a Capact cluster on [EKS](./installation/aws-eks.md) or [GKE](./installation/gcp-gke.md).
3. Learn how to create TypeInstances with [AWS](./example/typeinstances.md#aws-credentials) or [GCP](./example/typeinstances.md#gcp-service-account) credentials.
4. Learn about [Global Policies](./feature/policies/action-policy.md) to find out how to customize all Action executions.
5. Learn how to [change the source of Public Hub manifests](./example/public-hub-content.mdx#change-the-hub-manifest-source).
6. Share feedback via [**Slack**](/community/slack) or [**GitHub**](https://github.com/capactio/capact/issues)!

## <Icon iconName="file_copy" /> Content Developer

Content Developer develops new Hub manifests, such as [Interfaces](https://github.com/capactio/capact/tree/main/ocf-spec/0.0.1/README.md#interface), [Implementations](https://github.com/capactio/capact/tree/main/ocf-spec/0.0.1/README.md#implementation), [Types](https://github.com/capactio/capact/tree/main/ocf-spec/0.0.1/README.md#type), etc.

1. Get familiar with the resources described in the [System User](#system-user) section.
2. Read the [Content development guide](./content-development/guide.md) to learn more about Hub manifests. As a result, it will be easier to understand and modify generated manifests described in the next step.
3. Generate manifests for a [Helm chart](./content-development/generating.md#generating-helm-implementation) or a [Terraform module](./content-development/generating.md#generating-terraform-implementation).
5. Learn how to [manually populate the local manifests](./example/public-hub-content.mdx#populate-the-manifests-into-hub).
7. [Share your manifests](./example/public-hub-content.mdx#submit-manifest-to-the-community-repository)!
6. Share feedback via [**Slack**](/community/slack) or [**GitHub**](https://github.com/capactio/capact/issues)!

### Advanced concepts

1. Learn about the [Workflow Step Policy](./feature/policies/workflow-step-policy.md) to customize Action execution and try to use it in your workflows.
2. Learn how to [create a new runner](./architecture/runner.md#development) in the idiomatic way.

1. Get familiar with the resources described in the [Glossary and Concepts](#glossary-and-concepts) section.
2. Get familiar with the resources described in the [System User](#system-user) section.
3. Make sure an issue related to your change is reported according to our [contributing process](/community/contributing#create-a-pull-request).
4. Assign yourself to the related GitHub issue.
3. [Set up a local Capact repository](/community/development/git-workflow).
4. Get familiar with the guidelines listed in [Development guidelines](/community/development/development-guidelines).
