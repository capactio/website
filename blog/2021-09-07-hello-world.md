In a series of future blog posts we will highlight Capact features and cover some technical details for all interested developers out there.

Also, **a brand-new release**, Capact 0.5.0, is **just around the corner**. We're working very hard to bring many UX improvements, both for Capact users and content developers. The list includes:
- complete Action input validation, and more advanced, concurrent Capact manifests validation with optional server-side checks,
- experimental content development tools for Helm and Terraform-based (AWS and GCP) manifest generation,
- Policy syntax and behavior changes for improving consistency and usability,
- verbose output for Capact CLI,
- dependency updates, including migration to Argo 3,
- and much more!

Stay tuned for the official announcement!
