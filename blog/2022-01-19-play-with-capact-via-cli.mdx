Our first blog post focused strongly on **_why_**. Now it's time for **_how_**. Although, there are many ways to [get started with Capact](/docs/next/getting-started), today we will focus on your perspective as a
Capact User.

The recommended way to try out Capact quickly is to set up a local environment.

import { GetStartedTerminal } from '@site/src/components/homepage/GetStartedTerminal';

<GetStartedTerminal latest="true"/>
<br />

Detailed instructions are already nicely described in our [local installation](/docs/next/installation/local) tutorial. Once you have Capact up and running, we can start!

### What you will learn

:::info
For this blog post, we will use Capact CLI. However, the described scenario can also be executed with our [brand-new UI](/docs/next/dashboard-ui/overview)! ðŸ˜Ž
:::

In 5 minutes, by running examples from this blog post, you will learn about the following Capact concepts:

- [Interface](https://github.com/capactio/capact/blob/main/ocf-spec/0.0.1/README.md#interface)â€”provides an option to abstract Implementations.
- [Implementation](https://github.com/capactio/capact/blob/main/ocf-spec/0.0.1/README.md#implementation)â€”defines the actual workflow that is executed.
- [Attribute](https://github.com/capactio/capact/blob/main/ocf-spec/0.0.1/README.md#attribute)â€”provides an option to _tag_ manifests. Today we will use it to select a specific Implementation.
- [Type and TypeInstance](https://github.com/capactio/capact/blob/main/ocf-spec/0.0.1/README.md#type)â€”provide a combined feature, where Type holds the schema and TypeInstance the _instance_ for the Type.
- [Action](/docs/next/terminology#action)â€”triggers Engine to render and run a given Interface.
- [Policy](/docs/next/feature/policies/overview)â€”impacts the render process to select desired Implementations.

Creating new workflows will be a story for other blog posts.

Here we only briefly describe each part, but I encourage you to take a deeper look at our [Terminology](/docs/next/terminology) section later.

### Scenario

The key concepts were described in the [Introducing Capact](https://capact.io/blog/introducing-capact#capact-concept-in-one-minute) blog post. There, we used Mattermost as an example. It was a real life scenario but at the same time more resource and time-consuming.

For the purpose of this blog post, we created an extremely simple Hello World example.

import ThemedImage from '@theme/ThemedImage';
import useBaseUrl from '@docusaurus/useBaseUrl';

<ThemedImage
alt="Simplified architecture"
sources={{
light: useBaseUrl('/blog/2022-01-19/greet-manifests.svg'),
dark: useBaseUrl('/blog/2022-01-19/greet-manifests-dark.svg'),
}}
/>

There are two Implementations for the `cap.interface.capactio.examples.say` Interface. Depending on the Policy, a different Implementation is selected. By default, Engine selects the Implementation which is first on the list (alphabetical order) and doesn't have any requirements regarding executions, such as requiring AWS credentials.

## Camera, Lights, Action!

Action is the entry point for executing any Interface. It allows you to define which Interface should be executed and with which parameters. This is later consumed by Capact Engine and the appropriate workflow is rendered. Later, you can review it and approve it for the execution.

<ThemedImage
alt="Simplified architecture"
sources={{
light: useBaseUrl('/blog/2022-01-19/capact-simplified-arch.svg'),
dark: useBaseUrl('/blog/2022-01-19/capact-simplified-arch-dark.svg'),
}}
/>

### Steps

1. [Make sure that you are logged into local cluster](/docs/cli/getting-started#first-use).
2. List available Interfaces:

  ```bash
  capact hub interfaces get
  ```

  We are interested in this part:

    ```text {5,7,8}
                               PATH          LATEST REVISION                  IMPLEMENTATIONS
    ---------------------------------------+-----------------+-----------------------------------------------
    # ... trimmed ...
    ---------------------------------------+-----------------+-----------------------------------------------
    cap.interface.capactio.examples.greet        0.1.0             cap.implementation.capactio.examples.greet
    ---------------------------------------+-----------------+-----------------------------------------------
    cap.interface.capactio.examples.say          0.1.0             cap.implementation.capactio.examples.hello
                                                                   cap.implementation.capactio.examples.ricky
    ```

3. Create a new Action:

import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';

<div className="tab-container-nested">
<Tabs
groupId="ref"
defaultValue="def"
values={[
{label: 'Default Execution', value: 'def'},
{label: 'Policy-Changed Execution', value: 'policy'},
]}>
<TabItem value="def">

:::note
A Policy is not needed as we use the default behavior here.
:::

```bash
capact act create --name hello cap.interface.capactio.examples.greet
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="policy">

First, save the Policy to the `/tmp/policy.yaml` file:

```yaml title="/tmp/policy.yaml"
cat <<EOF > /tmp/policy.yaml
rules:
  - interface:
      path: cap.interface.capactio.examples.say
    oneOf:
    - implementationConstraints:
        attributes:
          - path: cap.attribute.capactio.examples.be-positive
            revision: 0.1.0
EOF
```

Next, create the Action with the Policy:

```bash
capact act create --name hello cap.interface.capactio.examples.greet --action-policy-from-file /tmp/policy.yaml
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>
</div>

2. Wait for the Action to have the `READY_TO_RUN` status:

	```bash
	capact act get hello
	```
3. When the status is `READY_TO_RUN`, run the Action:

	```bash
	capact act run hello
	```
4. Watch the progress:

	```bash
	capact act watch hello
	```
5. **(Optional)** Once the Action is finished, copy the name of the Pod for the `print` workflow step (column `PODNAME`). To read its logs, run:

	```bash
	kubectl logs {PODNAME} main
	```
  Example output:

<div className="tab-container-nested">
<Tabs
className="disable-tabs"
groupId="ref"
defaultValue="def"
values={[
{label: 'Default Execution', value: 'def'},
{label: 'Policy-Changed Execution', value: 'policy'},
]}>
<TabItem value="def">

```bash
 ____________________________

           ## ## ## ##      ===
       /""""""""""""""""___/ ===

        \    \        __/
          \____\______/
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="policy">

```bash
 __________________________________

     \
      \
                    ##        .

        \    \        __/
          \____\______/
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>
</div>

6. Get the Action output (TypeInstance). Copy the `id` field value:

	```bash
	capact act get hello -ojson | jq '.Actions[0].output.typeInstances'
	```

	Example output:
	```bash {3}
  [
    {
      "id": "08fcaa07-7846-47af-b6a7-7c3818c69656",
      "typeRef": {
        "path": "cap.type.capactio.examples.message",
        "revision": "0.1.0"
      }
    }
  ]
	```

7. Get the TypeInstance `value.message` field value:

   ```bash
   capact ti get {ID} -ojson | jq -r '.[0].latestResourceVersion.spec.value.message'
   ```

8. Delete the Action:

   ```bash
   capact act delete hello
   ```

Let's consider another example, as life isnâ€™t all sunshine and rainbows. Sometimes we need a more positively-colored message. Capact allows you to do it with ease âœ¨

To choose a different Implementation for the `say` Interface, we need to prepare a dedicated Policy. The power of it is that you don't have to change the main workflow. You treat the step as a building block and just swap it for another existing one.

To test it, execute [steps](#steps) once again, but now select the **Policy-Changed Execution** tab.

## What is so special about it?

Our example was simplified to a minimum, but you could see that you can:

- chain different steps together,
- and more importantly, write once and swap implementation details with ease.

Capact is also great if you want to chain different tools together and keep the same entry point (UX) but that requires more complex examples. For now, we recommend you to take a look at our other examples described in the [**How can I get involved and learn more?**](#how-can-i-get-involved-and-learn-more) section.

## Behind the wall

As you saw, you can use CLI to browse Hub manifests, create a specific Action for a given Interface and retrieve the output. CLI communicates with our Gateway via GraphQL calls, same as the UI (Capact Dashboard). You can read more in the [E2E Architecture](/docs/next/architecture/e2e-architecture) document.

However, a more important question is, how did we change the output message?

<div className="line-numbers">

```yaml {4-7,12} title="Implementation Manifest"
spec:
  # ... trimmed ...
  imports:
    - interfaceGroupPath: cap.interface.capactio.examples
      alias: examples
      methods:
        - name: say

  # ... trimmed ...
  steps:
    - - name: get-message
        capact-action: examples.say # dynamic step, rendered by Engine based on the Policy.
    - - name: print
        template: print
        arguments:
          artifacts:
            - name: message
            from: "{{steps.get-message.outputs.artifacts.message}}"
    # ... trimmed ...
    - name: print
      inputs:
        artifacts:
          - name: message
          path: /tmp/message.yaml
      container:
        image: docker/whalesay:latest
        command: [ sh, -c ]
        args: [ "cowsay < /tmp/message.yaml" ]
```

</div>

The snippet above shows the most important parts of the Implementation manifest. In lines **4-7**, we declare the import, which is later used in steps. In line **12**, we use **capact-action** to make a dynamic step with a given Interface.

:::tip
Instead of providing the full Interface path, we use **alias** assigned to the imported Interface.
:::

As a result, our Engine and, in particular, Argo Renderer has an option to put there an Implementation that fulfills the specified Interface. Thanks to that, this step is swappable based on the defined Policy.

## How can I get involved and learn more?

The [Getting Started](/docs/next/getting-started) goes into more detail about how to start with Capact and use its more-advanced features.
